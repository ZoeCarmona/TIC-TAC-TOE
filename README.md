## TIC-TAC-TOE
This project was developed for my Artificial Intelligence course. The goal was to create a 4x4 Tic-Tac-Toe game where users can play against the machine at three different difficulty levels:

1. **Easy**: The machine does not aim to win.
2. **Medium**: The machine plays with more strategy.
3. **Hard**: The machine actively seeks to win.

This project utilizes:
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
